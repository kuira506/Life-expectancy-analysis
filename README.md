# Life Expectancy Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project explores how life expectancy varies across countries and investigates how GDP per capita, education level, and healthcare spending contribute to those differences. I used datasets from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) and the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/).

## Main Research Question
What factors influence life expectancy across countries, and how do GDP, education, and healthcare spending explain those differences?

## Sub-Questions
- How has global life expectancy changed over time?
- How does life expectancy differ between countries?
- What is the relationship between life expectancy and socioeconomic indicators?
- Which factor contributes most to life expectancy?
- Can we predict life expectancy using regression?
- Can we group countries using clustering?

## Methods & Techniques
- Data cleaning and merging in Python
- Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Correlation analysis
- **New Technique:** Linear regression using scikit-learn
- K-Means clustering

## Key Insight
GDP per capita had the strongest correlation with life expectancy, but education and healthcare spending also played important roles.
